NBA News Scroll shows the top 10 NBA headlines, updated every 3-4 hours during the regular season.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a simple, straightforward news scroller to your website, which rotates the top ten latest NBA headlines. The scroller's news feed is update multiple times per day, so that your blog visitors can get the most current news.

Blog owners can fully customize the font color of the scroller, and the backgrounds of each even and odd news items (ie. items 1,3,5... yellow background; 2,4,6... white background). The scroller automatically numbers the 10 news items, and puts the news item titles in bold in order to make them stand out on your pages. The scroller moves along slowly, stopping for 6 seconds each time a headline reaches the top of the scroller window.

Please note, this plugin is supported by text link advertising. Accordingly, bloggers will see 4 links displayed at the bottom of their 
stats table, which will remain the same once the plugin has been installed. Please do not modify these links - this is how we pay the bills. 

We have no outward 
preference where our plugin appears, as long as the website content is legal in its particular jurisdiction. For example, some <a href="http://www.sportsbetting3.com">college football betting</a> 
bloggers like to use the stats to complement NBA content on their sites, while more hard core <a href="http://www.online-casinos-online.us">online casinos</a> enthusiasts will use multiple instances 
of the stats panel across their blog to display complete team figures. This plugin is licensed under WordPress.org guidelines and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">General Public License</a>.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `nba-news-scroll` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. The Plugin will automatically install a new table on your database to store your team and display size selections.
4. It might be necessary to upload a `crossdomain.xml` file to your website's root folder (where the `wp-config.php` file is stored). This file allows the Flash news scroller to function much more efficiently, and restricts access to our server only. If you need this file, you will be alerted in the NBA News Scroller settings panel, and offered a download link to get the file.
5. Go to your Design section and select the NBA Scroller widget.
6. Place the widget where you would like it to appear in your sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
